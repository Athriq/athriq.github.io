My most proper game prototype ever. It's intended to be a grand remake of the popular horror game of the same name in Unity3D but I only got around to doing the intro part. I've since lost the project files, although some of the (spaghetti) code are still [available for view](https://github.com/Athriq/SCPCB-Remake-Scripts).
