## A little about me.

Halo. My name is **Ahmad Ghalib Athariq**, I'm 20 years old. I live in <abbr title="Eastern Hemisphere of the Earth, Solar System, Orion Arm of the Milky Way, Local Group, The Observable Universe">Medan, Indonesia</abbr>. I have been coding since I was little to make things I love and I'm eager to build meaningful software that help improve people's lives. I'm currently studying at a university in the same city majoring in computer science.

As a kid who spent too much time playing games, I discovered game making tools at a relatively young age, which I found to bean ideal space to channel my inner burning creativity into the digital world. Along the way, I learnt the art of programming as a side effect and the field of computing in general which I intend to have a career in. In between all of that, I have *some* interest in writing and art.

Beyond that, I always have a deep fascination with the sciences and nature, often pondering in philosophical thoughts andappreciating the beauty of the world, the society, civilization, humankind and this life. I yearn to find meaning in everydaylife and contribute something good to the world around me.

I may write my personal thoughts on various topics on my [blog](/blog) from time to time.

Thanks for reading :)
