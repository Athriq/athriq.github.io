## Projects

[Thrive](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive) - Not my personal project but a free and open-source game by [Revolutionary Games Studio](https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com) which I'm heavily involved in as a volunteer since 2020. As a member of the core programming team, I work on various things from user interface, gameplay features to bug-fixing. Often, I'm also involved in reviewing pull requests to the codebase made by open-source contributors and fellow team members.

[MixTime](https://mixtime.rf.gd) - An e-menu website I built with Laravel and with responsive UI for a drinks vendor. It showcases items in a grid-based layout as "picture cards" which you can open to show detailed view of the item. It also features basic CRUD for administrative functionality and email notification system to allow users to send feedbacks of products. Currently, not being used much...

[Chat Web App](https://agachat.000webhostapp.com) - A Discord-like web application I've made as part of a college assignment in Web programming. Applied some form of HTTP long polling technique to get a semi-realtime feedback of chat messages. Learnt about the basics of HTTP protocol.

[Blabble](https://github.com/ReQuill/Blabble) - A native anonymous chat app for Android, much like Omegle but text-based (think WhatsApp or Telegram). The core idea is that by choosing from a list of topics, you can then link up with another person that matches your topics automatically and start chatting. All without requiring you to register to the app, the mechanisms of which utilizes Firebase's features, mainly Functions in the [backend-side](https://github.com/ReQuill/BlabbleBackend) (my area of focus). This was part of a college group-assignment in Mobile Programming course which implements project-based learning.

[Space Shooter game](https://github.com/Athriq/SpaceShooterX) - Out of all the many game _prototypes_ I've made, this is the most presentable, code-wise. It's a command-prompt based Shoot 'em up game where you play as a spaceship captain whose job is to destroy alien spaceships. I made this project as more of a coding experiment for me to learn Win32 APIs.

[SCP: Containment Breach remake](https://youtu.be/7MZoKJcwf0c) - My most presentable game project, visually. It's intended to be a grand remake of the popular horror game of the same name in Unity3d but I only got around to doing the intro part. I've since lost the project files, although some of the (spaghetti) code are still [available for view](https://github.com/Athriq/SCPCB-Remake-Scripts).
